K-means classification of listed companies to economic sectors based on the price movement and visualization of price and stock volume changes (different algorythms and the dashboard in the future). Sample results below.

### K-means:
This clustering algorithm seeks to partition a set of points into K sets (clusters) such that the points in each cluster tend to be near each other.
It is unsupervised method since the points have no external classification.

### mWIG40:
Stock price index of medium-sized companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
It consists of a fixed number of 40 companies.

### Sample results:
